<PRE>IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN DEVELOPMENT, OR DISCUSSION RELATED TO 
DEVELOPMENT PLEASE SUBSCRIBE TO <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/qrc-devel">qrc-devel at berlios.de.</A>
<A HREF="http://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/qrc-devel">http://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/qrc-devel</A>

No further development discussion should occur on this list. This list 
is for usage-level discussion.

Wow. Quite a discussion suddenly appears here. Let me add my comments:

1. We ain't porting nothin' to Win32 (or Win64). 'nuff said.

1.5. I prefer SVN 1000 times more than CVS. If Sourceforge supports SVN 
repositories, I'll be happy to move back there.

2. While Garrett may have been a little catty and abrasive, responding 
with bitterness and concluding with &quot;GO AWAY&quot; is no more constructive, 
despite the existence of good points.

3. I've not worked on the plugin much lately, because it works for me, 
and frankly, I've got an essentially infinite number of more important 
things to do. The project has be come too much for one person to manage 
everything. I have put countless hours into the project (I'd say I was 
the primary developer for most of the project). I no longer feel like 
trying to fix every bug in two plugins, and come up with packages for 
distributions that I don't have, and have no interest in installing.

However, if more people were involved in active development of gaym, I'd 
feel that it was more important for me to do my part.

4. There's no need to scrap gaym-extras anymore then the other parts. No 
one is working on gaym-extras because no one is working on anything. 
Gaym-extras adds features that are important to the majority of gay.com 
chatters. I will, however, be OK with making the 1.x version gaym-extras 
an unsupported, use-at-your-own-risk plugin. The API for buddy icons 
really made that one a mess. I got it fixed for 2.0, so it is much neater.

So, here's the minimum of what we need to move this forward:

*A package maintainer. This person will take snapshots of the SVN tree, 
and create packages. This person should also do as much testing of the 
plugin as possible to find bugs.

*A prpl lead. This person should at the very least fix bugs in the prpl.

*A GUI lead. This person should at the very least fix bugs in the 
gaym-extras plugin. If the first two positions were filled, I'd be happy 
to step in here.
