Message-ID: <1122966933.7738.14.camel@localhost>

Hi everyone,

	There's a new version of gaym up on the berlios web page. Currently,
the only available files are a windows .exe installar, and a linux
tar.bz2. If anyone would like to make .debs or .rpms, that would be
great. 

	If you experience any weird behavior, please file a bug report on the
berlios page, or at LEAST send an email to qrc-devel at berlios.de (NOT the
yahoo group). If you are able to get a backtrace, either through GDB or
DrMinGW, that would be a big help! 

Jason

Doesn't look like Thumbnails are showing in private IMs.  The popup
works, but the place where there is usually an icon (like with Yahoo or
AIM) is gone.

Also, try turning the gaym-extras on and off a few times (BURP!)  

Seems to not like that :(

Its looking really good though.

This is likely buggy, but its not crashing and it looks better than gaim
(to me), and it should be possible to add thumbs for each person that
speaks without too much trouble - dunno about getting the backgrounds -
likely not possible.

Anyway - also removes "repeats" in the channel!  You never see it if
someone repeats the same thing over and over (should likely do this for
join/parts for people that are using a broken hammer that takes them in
and out of a room 20 times to find the right one).

Been playing with the colors .. its possible the best bet would be to
increment the color index when a new person speaks and save it in a hash
instead of trying to use the username to generate an index.  Then again,
maybe its ok.

The code is attached if you wanna play with it.

Just found a bug in revision 272:  If you disconnect without closing a
room window, then reconnect and rejoin that room, two photos will
appear in the footer of that window, one of which is the last photo to
appear on the previous connection, the other is the photo of any
currently selected user.

I've committed code that fixes this bug, so SVN head fixes it. I'll post
new windows releases and tarballs soon. Thanks to Tilghman and Evan for
the report. Incidentally, it was also making a second sort button.

You didn't notice, because for some reason, you are not getting the
sort-order icons. Are you using the windows version or the linux
version? Can you give me a gaim -d debug dump of startup? That is, run
gaim -d, and email me all the debug output (don't log into any
protocols).

Does ANYONE actively use the Windows version?

Thanks,

Jason

Interestingly enough, the above pixmaps are not in /usr/local,

I have a few friends who do, but I do not.

This is a common problem.   It looks like the icons are using the --prefix
option for the install directory sometimes instead of the one gaim is 
installed
in, so run ./configure with --prefix=/usr and it will work.

I started one person on the Windows version.  He gets lock-ups.  Dunno why - I
haven't had time to test it.

Did the "display" stuff get committed?   Its pretty experimental - I use it
daily, but there are known bugs.

Is anyone working on the Get Info dialog?

A friend of mine won't switch to Gaim because hes a paying member and 
can't see
pictures beyond the first from within the program - he'd rather not 
have to use
the browser to see the other pics.

Apparently, the biggest problem is that its not obvious if more than picture
exists, so its annoying to waste the time for a browser to load a web 
page just
to find out that no additional information (or pictures) are available.

If no one else is playing with it - I might.

I think that, if more than one picture exists, you can tell after the
fetch of profile.txt?name

Maybe I'll get the "free trial" account some time and try and figure it
out really fast :) 

I have no desire to pay for the extra features. I wouldn't use them.

Yeah - I can look and see what information is available.  I have his

I can test things pretty easily :)

How can I force a thumbnail to update?

I changed my gay.com picture a few days ago and I was still getting the old
thumbnail, at least in gaym (not sure about anything else).  Anyway, since it
wasn't updating, I deleted gothwolf.jpg and the gothwolf/ directory from the
icons/gaym directory (why is there both?) and now I have no thumbnail, and
can't seem to find a way to get it to load a new one :(

Also ... the size of that icons/gaym directory is HUGE.  I'm showing 6401
subdirectories in there and 650+ jpg files, and a du -k is showing 41738 ...
which is nearly 42MB of icons!    I know reiserfs is pretty efficient about
lots of directories, but everything has its limits.  I'd hate to see the
performance on file systems that aren't as efficient with huge numbers 
of files
in a directory.   Might want to break things down to having another 53
directories based on the starting letter of the nick [a-zA-Z.] where 
'.' is any
non-letter.  Might also want to expire some of that old shit.
