Hmm ... Okay.  Is Gaim 2.0 CVS useable, and can gaym work with it at
all?   I'm wondering if we've hit a plato where the code is useable
enough that we should start concentrating on Gaim 2.0 instead.

OK .. The current code uses an &lt;img&gt; tag for the picture.  Can I do the
same to load up every thumbnail in the mini-profile and attach some sort
of callback to change the image data for the large picture when any of
the smaller ones are clicked?  Thats kinda the plan, although I don't
know the exact steps to do it just yet (looking into the existing code
to figure out how).  Hints appreciated.

Also, if I use the &lt;img&gt; tag inside the display plugin ... is there some
easy function to call that to get the right thumbnail, caching it if its
loaded and load one if not cached?   Basically, with such a large
scrollback, we could be keeping thumbs around forever if they are in the
chatroom message display (next to what they said), and I'm not sure when
they would actually be removed from scrollback so we can free it.
Ideas?  Comments?

Ideally, I want clicking the name or thumb to do a Get Info as well, and
change up the Get Info so that pulling up the whole profile is rarely
necessary - as much info as the mini profile has should be in the
dialog.

This is the extent of the changes I care to make at the moment.

Right now, I've made the following two hac^h^h^hchanges.
* Using the /whois command actually does the same as &quot;Get Info&quot;.  The
dialog appears
* The profile &quot;heading&quot; is attached to the Get Info display.

Diff is attached for these changes, please look over and add em.
I should probably get an account so I can comitt these myself.
