<PRE>I would eventually like to re-integrate the &quot;fork&quot;.

This would basically mean either a bot-detection plugin and some minor changes
to the challenger plugin, or roll it all into the challenger plugin.  This
would depend on the ability for the challenger plugin to access the lists that
the bot-detection code generates.  Is there an easy (and safe) way for one
plugin to detect if another plugin is in use, and then access the its data
through some structure?

I would also need the to coordinate certain things where the code currently
sends a string right to gaym_bot_detect() ... such as when a new window should
open and it does a WHOIS to get the photo.   Here the bioline is checked for
&quot;bad&quot; URLs.  I've yet to figure out what level the bot-detection plugin would
need to &quot;hook into&quot; to catch this data without having to call gaym_bot_detect
directly, as this would ideally be moved into its own bot-detection plugin.
Basically, gaym_bot_detect needs a string to look at (be it a message or
bioline) and the name of the user that sent that string, and which
protocol/network is being used.  If 1 hook can be done for all messages
including the WHOIS message and all public and private messages, that would be
great.

I think if this can be placed into a separate plugin that can work with or
without the challenger code and the challenger code can optionally use
information from the bot-detection code (if its loaded) then the code paths
should be much easier to develope without keeping things forked.  
Reintegration
would help everyone since it seems no one is even looking at the bot-detection
code as long as its forked.  Forked gaym is at

Suggestions welcome!
