</I>
Please compare with the fork.  You are dividing up a filter for rooms
and a filter for IMs, but you were the one that wanted to keep things
consistent.  If you are going to put a bot filter in SVN, just merge in
the fork.  Otherwise the lack of integration and rather limited
usefulness is only going to give people a bad impression.

I've not had a single bot IM me or spam a channel .. or rather .. not
that I could see, and I have the challenge/response set to only
challenge people already marked as bots so I'm never annoying the vast
majority.  In fact, I'm pretty close to 100%.

&gt;<i> This commit merits some discussion.  First, let me note that this is
</I>&gt;<i> only an interim solution so that we can make a release soon.  It is not
</I>&gt;<i> by any means the last word on bot-filtering.  It is only an attempt to
</I>&gt;<i> get qrc to a state where we can build an interim release.
</I>
leave it out or put it all in.

&gt;<i> Second, it may be rightly argued that this belongs in a plugin.
</I>&gt;<i> However, gaim-1.3.1 does not provide signal access to join messages
</I>&gt;<i> (which is where data from the user's bio is currently seen outside of
</I>&gt;<i> the prpl itself).  This means we either need to provide a patch to gaim
</I>&gt;<i> or otherwise come up with some exceptional hacking.  In other words,
</I>&gt;<i> this is not easily available for a short term interim release.
</I>
Join issues can be solved with the same hack that is used for making
system messages smaller.  In fact - you can catch &amp; filter all text that
way.

&gt;<i> Third, I would still like to see some more of Evan's bot filtering ideas
</I>&gt;<i> and patches in qrc, but I would like to follow a more &quot;correct&quot; approach
</I>&gt;<i> to these so that they don't end up getting discarded or re-worked later
</I>&gt;<i> (as my commit will be when we properly integrate Evan's).
</I>
I've been super busy lately - look through the code - it isn't THAT bad!

&gt;<i> Finally, I would like to remove &quot;Only buddies may open an IM session to
</I>&gt;<i> me&quot;, and then have perhaps a week of feature freeze / testing before
</I>&gt;<i> releasing qrc-0.34.0.
</I>
I don't have a problem with that :)
