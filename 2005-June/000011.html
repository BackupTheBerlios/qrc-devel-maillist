<PRE>Hi Everyone,

I would like to make a release of qrc-0.34.0 soon.

While we still have much to do, I think it is time to make a new release
so that people don't have to find some nightly build to use the new
features that have been added since 2004-12-13.

Of course, we should be arguably better that the 0.21.0 or 0.33.0
releases, and should not have regressed in comparison to those releases
(in any way).

To that end, I've committed &quot;Bio-Based Chat Room Activity Filtering&quot; to
svn.  This is to address the deficiency (regression) caused when I
earlier removed hard coded bot filtering strings.  It is a patch I
constructed some time ago and and discarded because it didn't seem all
that effective (I was trying to make something that handled both chat
room and IM issues).  In light of bot-challenger, I've reworked it to
apply only to chat rooms.  Otherwise, its primary difference from the
earlier approach is that none of the strings are hard coded, it can be
turned on/off, and it doesn't add to the ignore list when triggered.

This commit merits some discussion.  First, let me note that this is
only an interim solution so that we can make a release soon.  It is not
by any means the last word on bot-filtering.  It is only an attempt to
get qrc to a state where we can build an interim release.

Second, it may be rightly argued that this belongs in a plugin.
However, gaim-1.3.1 does not provide signal access to join messages
(which is where data from the user's bio is currently seen outside of
the prpl itself).  This means we either need to provide a patch to gaim
or otherwise come up with some exceptional hacking.  In other words,
this is not easily available for a short term interim release.

Third, I would still like to see some more of Evan's bot filtering ideas
and patches in qrc, but I would like to follow a more &quot;correct&quot; approach
to these so that they don't end up getting discarded or re-worked later
(as my commit will be when we properly integrate Evan's).

Finally, I would like to remove &quot;Only buddies may open an IM session to
me&quot;, and then have perhaps a week of feature freeze / testing before
releasing qrc-0.34.0.

Please let me know what your thoughts are on all of this.  I think as of
now, we should have no regressions from any of the previous interim
releases, but I can't say this on my own.  Verification and testing from
others is needed.

Thanks,
Dave.
