<PRE>Evan,

Thank you for sharing your opinions on the topic of whether we are ready
for an interim release.

Please note that I'm unwilling to go with an &quot;all or nothing&quot; approach
with respect to merging your changes into svn for this interim release.
A few of the primary reasons are:

  - Your changes are not yet appropriate for full merge.  Even your own
    comments within the code indicate this.  Comments such as &quot;This
    seems to change all protocols.&quot;

  - Your changes are to an older version, and as such cannot quickly be
    merged into the current version.  There is not even a patch to
    consider.  We are all busy.  It will take much time to compare your
    source code with current svn and identify which are the relevant
    differences.  (FYI...most projects require proposed patches to be
    made against HEAD.  And with good reason.  Its very hard to know
    what someone intends when their patch appears to roll back fixes and
    improvements made since the patch was created.)

  - The argument that &quot;its not good enough&quot; does not hold for an interim
    release of beta software:  if it did, we wouldn't have made any
    releases yet.  The question that must be answered for an interim
    beta release, is &quot;can we say that the release is  better than the
    previous release?&quot;.  And if you are arguing that No Filtering is
    better than Some Filtering, please make your case with detailed
    facts.  The previous Filtering was similar to what is in svn now,
    except what is in svn now is not hard coded.  This is better because
    a user doesn't have to recompile the software just to
    add/change/delete a filtering rule.

But as a compromise, I've added the retrieval and use of GayBoi's spam
list, in addition to the customizable filtering rules.  I've also heard
from others that this is a greatly desired feature.

In summary, I haven't seen any logic indicating that current svn is
worse than what was in our previous interim beta releases
(0.21.0/0.33.0).  But I remain open to additional facts in this regard.
And in absence of such facts, I intend to proceed as proposed.

And I remain committed to work with you so as to incrementally bring
more of your changes into svn.  But this will require effort and
cooperation on both of our parts--as our schedules permit.  And when we
don't have time, it shouldn't force delay onto other aspects of the
project.

Thanks again for your input,
Dave.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To that end, I've committed &quot;Bio-Based Chat Room Activity Filtering&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to svn.  This is to address the deficiency (regression) caused when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I earlier removed hard coded bot filtering strings.  It is a patch I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; constructed some time ago and and discarded because it didn't seem
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all that effective (I was trying to make something that handled both
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; chat room and IM issues).  In light of bot-challenger, I've reworked
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it to apply only to chat rooms.  Otherwise, its primary difference
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from the earlier approach is that none of the strings are hard
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; coded, it can be turned on/off, and it doesn't add to the ignore
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; list when triggered.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please compare with the fork.  You are dividing up a filter for rooms
</I>&gt;<i> and a filter for IMs, but you were the one that wanted to keep things
</I>&gt;<i> consistent.  If you are going to put a bot filter in SVN, just merge
</I>&gt;<i> in the fork.  Otherwise the lack of integration and rather limited
</I>&gt;<i> usefulness is only going to give people a bad impression.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've not had a single bot IM me or spam a channel .. or rather .. not
</I>&gt;<i> that I could see, and I have the challenge/response set to only
</I>&gt;<i> challenge people already marked as bots so I'm never annoying the vast
</I>&gt;<i> majority.  In fact, I'm pretty close to 100%.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This commit merits some discussion.  First, let me note that this is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only an interim solution so that we can make a release soon.  It is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not by any means the last word on bot-filtering.  It is only an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; attempt to get qrc to a state where we can build an interim release.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> leave it out or put it all in.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Second, it may be rightly argued that this belongs in a plugin.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, gaim-1.3.1 does not provide signal access to join messages
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (which is where data from the user's bio is currently seen outside
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the prpl itself).  This means we either need to provide a patch
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to gaim or otherwise come up with some exceptional hacking.  In
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other words, this is not easily available for a short term interim
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; release.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Join issues can be solved with the same hack that is used for making
</I>&gt;<i> system messages smaller.  In fact - you can catch &amp; filter all text
</I>&gt;<i> that way.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Third, I would still like to see some more of Evan's bot filtering
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ideas and patches in qrc, but I would like to follow a more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;correct&quot; approach to these so that they don't end up getting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; discarded or re-worked later (as my commit will be when we properly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; integrate Evan's).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've been super busy lately - look through the code - it isn't THAT
</I>&gt;<i> bad!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Finally, I would like to remove &quot;Only buddies may open an IM session
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to me&quot;, and then have perhaps a week of feature freeze / testing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; before releasing qrc-0.34.0.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't have a problem with that :)
