<PRE>&gt;<i> Yay!  Names rock.  If there is no Location given, and the name is pretty long,
</I>&gt;<i> then it gets cut slightly.  Looks like the code doesn't know that an italic
</I>&gt;<i> takes up more room - can probably just bump up the width slightly.  Also it
</I>&gt;<i> looks like the height is off too.  There is a nice border on the top and sides
</I>&gt;<i> of the thumbnail in the popup, but some users have just a BIO and nothing else
</I>&gt;<i> in the popup, so the thumbnail is on the very edge of the popup.  It doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> look like it gets cut off .. but the zero border makes you wonder if it did or
</I>&gt;<i> not.
</I>
If you find users that have oddly rendering bio popups, give me their
names, so I can check them out. Same with bizarre corner icons in the
chat panes.

&gt;<i> Is the sort icon/letters supposed to show the current sort or supposed to show
</I>&gt;<i> what it will sort as if you click it.  It doesn't quite seem like its
</I>&gt;<i> consistent - maybe its me.  It starts as E and sorts right, but as you change
</I>&gt;<i> it, it stops making sense.
</I>
Logic bug. Should be fixed, with tooltips to help.

&gt;<i> Did you get the icons?  Not like em?
</I>
Just put 'em in the latest commit.

&gt;<i> &gt; That's fine. Hopefully HEAD will become stable today.
</I>&gt;<i> So far so good.  Its really fast at pulling those pics from the cache
</I>
When you join a room, it runs down the list, compares URLs with the
cache, and pipelines however many fetches it needs. You could have up to
100 HTTP requests firing off at once. I might have to change that, I'm
not sure if that is a bad thing or not.


&gt;<i> Oops .. wait .. SIGABRT .. looks like maybe a NULL pointer was passed 
</I>&gt;<i> (maybe as
</I>&gt;<i> a function pointer for a callback) to some gaim function and it logged it and
</I>&gt;<i> through an abort.  Maybe it was an assert?    If I can make it happen 
</I>&gt;<i> again and
</I>&gt;<i> figure out when it does it, I'll recompile gaim with DEBUG set so I can 
</I>&gt;<i> see what
</I>&gt;<i> that last function is.
</I>
Asserts (g_return_if_fail) shouldn't cause aborts, just logged error
messages. I have been pretty aggressive about handling NULL pointers,
and I think most of the code is null-safe. Usually my problems are
un-initialized pointers, lately.
