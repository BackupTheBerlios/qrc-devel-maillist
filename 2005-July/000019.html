<PRE>Greetings,

I've heard of no additional bugs that were not already in prior interim
releases, so I've tagged in svn, built the source dist for qrc-0.34.0,
and deployed it.

Based on this, I've also built and deployed the corresponding windows
package (it is built from gaim-1.3.0 but works also with gaim-1.3.1).

Additionally, I've built and uploaded corresponding debian/sarge
packages.  The Debian work is managed separately under a debian
subversion module within our berlios project's root.  It has also been
appropriately tagged within svn.  The Debian source and binary packages
are apt get-able as documented in qrc-debian.txt (on our project's
files page).

(Packaging is a distinctly separate activity from a source release.
If a bug is found in the package source there should be no need to
re-release the generic source.  I need to open a bug to separate windows
packaging similarly, since it currently lives in the main generic source
tree.)

Previously, i386 and src rpms have been built, but I have no system from
which to make this happen.  Have sent a note to Chris Weyl asking if he
would do this again, since he was the author of the previous rpms.

I'm not sure what system the original rpms were built for or anything,
but if anyone else knows what other packages can/should be available,
please let me know.

Hopefully, we can have another interim release soon.  (I personally find
bug 004424 -- and the overall cleanup of the &quot;.&quot; and &quot;|&quot; process --
particularly urgent, since it currently causes communication/protocol
interference under certain circumstances.)

Pending a stable release (1.0.0), lets stick to an x.y.z notation where
x = 0, y is incremented for new/changed user features and behavior (z =
0 for these), and z is incremented when the release is strictly a bug
fix.

Thanks,
Dave.
