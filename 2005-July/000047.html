<PRE>&gt;<i> Actually, gaym_fetch_info_cb() should use the photos found in
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.gay.com/messenger/get-profile.txt">http://www.gay.com/messenger/get-profile.txt</A> (ohm.profile-url from
</I>&gt;<i> confit.txt) and not the thumbnail found from the whois.  The whois
</I>&gt;<i> thumbnail is the smaller one used for buddy list, chatroom member list,
</I>&gt;<i> etc.  So while we do need to refactor this aspect, I disagree with this
</I>&gt;<i> approach.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I'm not sure what you mean, here. If there is a photo URL specified in
get-profile.txt, it is still used. As Evan said, if another user has an
adult picture, and the gaym user is not a &quot;premium&quot; member, then the
gaym user will be able to see the thumbnail, but not the full photo. I'd
like to see at least this thumbnail, rather than nothing at all.


&gt;<i> My impression here is that this indicates a highjacked thumbnail, which
</I>&gt;<i> is often used by bots.  Not sure we want to embrace this practice.  Can
</I>&gt;<i> we discuss?
</I>
See comment above.

&gt;<i> &gt; *msgs_names now populates the list if gaym-&gt;nameconv is null. So, on a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; join_msg, indicating a successful room join, a names command is immediately
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sent out. The response of that names message is what triggers list
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; population.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure I understand why we need this extra network call.  Are you
</I>&gt;<i> saying the original join result does not give the names in the order you
</I>&gt;<i> want?  What order does the join result give?  What does the java applet
</I>&gt;<i> do?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
When you join a room, the gay.com server responds with a series of
message #690, one for each user. Unfortunately, these messages come in
the order of &quot;newest first&quot;. If they came in the order &quot;oldest first,&quot;
there would be no problem. Assume that there were 5 people in the room
when you enter, and then one more enters after you. Then if you simply
sort by the order that the name list was populated, you'd see:

7
6 &lt;---you
1
2
3
4
5

Part of this solution has to do with the way gaim handles user joins.
There is only one signal: chat-buddy-joined. There is no way to
differentiate the behavior between joins that occur when you enter the
channel, and joins that occur after you enter the channel. Gaim just
automatically sorts the list by alpha, so it was never really an issue.
The best way to handle this would be a patch to Gaim that lets us handle
this properly. However, one of my goals personally throughout this
project has been to completely avoid requiring a patch to Gaim, since
many people are unlikely to bother.

The extra &quot;names&quot; call gives us a way to populate the list in one shot.
On further thought (i.e., as I've been typing this) I realize that a
temporary list could be populated as the 690's flow in, and then
reversed at the end. The trick is detecting the &quot;end&quot;. There is no
message to demarcate the end, so you have to insert *some* command of
your own that the server can respond to, that will signal the end.

I'm fairly certain that the flow of 690 messages will never be
interrupted. I did a lot of tests, and could not get them to be
interrupted by an intermediate command. I.e., the text flow always looks
like:

690 gaydude
690 guy
690 person
NAMES
690 queer
690 lost_dyke
690 jailbait
690 final_690
NAMES RESPONSE

I will make the changes now to avoid the NAMES command. I will replace
it with a PING, or something. Are there any thoughts about which command
the gay.com server will give the fastest response for? PING seems the
most likely candidate.
