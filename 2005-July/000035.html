Yup - and its a memory hog too - does EVER do a reverse search?  GList
is a doubly linked list  :/

And in the future, that would be a good place to stick any &quot;detect
number of rooms&quot; code.   Basically just a WHO or NAMES or whatever on
the =1, =2, =3, etc, until you don't get any results :)  This seems like
a good idea to me.

&gt;<i> What I don't see doing is somehow parsing only part of the config.txt

That wouldn't give you much benefit I don't think.  However, if you
wanted to do something similar, parse the whole list of rooms into some
other structure as an intermediate storage area (some sort of tree, and
without the leaf rooms which should still be on-the-fly).  Build it
directly without any searches.  Since its more closely modeled on the
gay.com room list tree, it should be faster to manipulate and possibly
may only require moving some pointers around when the user expands a
branch.
