<PRE>On the task of fightning bots and developing plugins ...

So, you have one of those new AI bots that wants to talk to you.  Its
BIO is clean - no URLS, like this one ...


Stats: Male | 19
Bio: Pvt is okay


Now here is the conversation:


gothwolf: Hi bot
amauglard: hello
gothwolf: lets test your AI
gothwolf: whats your name?
amauglard: see my profile with pics there -&gt; geocities.com/johncampage ** BOT ALERT **
gothwolf: got ya


You'll notice that the bot detector finally detected it when he posted
the URL, and if I had &quot;Ignore Bots&quot; turned on, he would have been put on
ignore at that point.   However, you'll notice that I already knew it
was a bot when I talked to him!

How?

Well, the /trace command will give an IP, and I've already logged the
most common IPs of bots.  There are so far only about 16 in total.  Of
these 16, 3 are from cantv.net and 1 of those 3 is on spamhaus.   Of the
other 13, 7 are on spamhaus.  Over 50% hit ratio is over 50% chance that
any new IP we see that is a bot, will be on the spamhaus site, and few
real users will ever be listed on spamhaus as a spammer (providing you
use the known spammer one and not the open-relay one, but this could be
optional).  Anyway ...

1 - the same IPs are used for multiple bots - once an IP is detected, a
database can block the whole IP and all the bots at that address.   This
is a huge win for incorporating an IP check and an IP list.

2 - Similarly, a reverse of the /trace IP to get the domain name can be
fed into any URL based scan, so that instead of blocking large lists of
IPs, we can block large spam operations by domain, such as the
&quot;genericrev.cantv.net&quot; provider that many bots resolve to (the 3 IPs I
mentioned above)

3 - new bots could be detected by checking their IP against spamhaus or
possibly other RBLs.   Some of these IPs had multiple listings and are
registered in China.  I bet if you look them up and read the full
description you'd find the IP linked to international spam gangs.   Much
of the email spam can be traced to Russian Mafia.  I wouldn't be
surprised if these adbots root there as well.

4 - bots detected via other methods (my current bot code tries to detect
other possibilities besides URL) or user interaction (plugins can add
buttons) can be submitted to a central database.   Eventually they'll
run out of IPs to use.  Anyone know someone that would host a global
BOTRBL?

While a general URL based scanner that watches public, private, and join
messages can catch quite a bit of spam bots, I think if the individual
protocols could communicate IP based information as well as any other
information it finds, such as in a profile or something, I think we
could really make this work well.
