<PRE>I've replied to the commit, but perhaps I should also reply to this...

Would you please help us understand why the additional complexity and
additional network traffic is needed here?  Does the join not already
provide the results in the correct order, or an order that would be
correct if it was reversed?

And how does this work with other prpls, such as Yahoo?  Is there a
customization required in them also, or do we need to conform to the
practice of the other prpls?

&gt;<i> If there is a general negative consensus, I will make a separate svn

</I>
The trunk is normally where the new stuff goes, so I have no issue with
that.  You'll notice Gaim follows this approach also.  So I have no
issue with your commit in this respect.

&gt;<i> r219 also throws thumbnails in the bio when full photo is not available.
</I>
Under what circumstances is a bio thumbnail available when a full photo
is not?  My impression is that this is only the case for spam/bots.  And
if my impression is correct, then I would disagree with enabling this
spam/bot behavior.
