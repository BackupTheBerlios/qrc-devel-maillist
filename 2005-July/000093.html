Ah ... ok.  But .. without the plugin enabled it still does this sort?
Or is my chatsort plugin just a leftover from a previous install?

</I>
Well, in the IM windows, the box around the icon changes size.  If you
scale the icon to the box the aspect ratio could be aweful.  Although, I
noticed some pics have really tiny thumbs for some odd reason.  You
could scale it, but I don't think there is enough information to scale.
If the box size can change, great.  If you have to change the icon size,
don't bother.

&gt;<i> In order to see &quot;Get Info&quot; you have to click another button, and then

</I>
I'm voting for just a smaller font, with maybe the Age &amp; Location
abbreviated like in stats, or use bold for the field names.  Other than
that and odd resizing of the window .. it works really well!

Now there is no more reason for anyone to use Chat Client!

&gt;<i> David mentioned that he is working on completely overhauling the
</I>&gt;<i> mini-profile. So I assume he will include your ideas.
</I>
Adding the profile heading to the Age/Location/Bio information you have
in the channel and IM windows may be beneficial.  Once you get used to
seeing this information, you miss it!   Its usually as informative as
the BIO, or better.

&gt;<i> &gt; I also miss my small joins with blue bios .. but I'll make a plugin to get it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; back one of these days :/
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can include this in the gaym-extras plugin.
</I>
I made a stand-alone plugin for it.  It just changes the size of the
system messages (and un-bolds them) - working on getting the BIO parsed
out and to another color - and eventually someone (maybe me) can add the
user interface options to make it all configurable ... I just can't
stand the big bold join/parts anymore.  

The main issue is that you can easily turn it off and system messages go
back to normal, but it needs to get a GaimConversationUiOps structure,
and all I could think of was to throw a signal in there so that you get
a GaimConv on joining a chanenl and can grab the UiOps from there.
Works fine unless you turn it off and then back on again ... you'll have
to rejoin the channel to get it working.

So .. there's probably a better way!  Suggestions welcome.  However, I
think this method has more possibilities for the future in twisting the
display capabilities
