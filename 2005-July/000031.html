I don't believe this will be reliable.

&gt;<i> For instance here is one raw:

</I>&gt;<i> playI'm Justin. See my page:  geocities . com / videojust
</I>
Under the new algorithm I want to implement, geocities isn't blocked
directly since some people have don't like that (false positives),
however I plan on having a secondary match list to check when geocities
is part of the tested string.  Since geocities matches above, we'd use
the secondary list, and videojust happens to be on that list.

So .. this would be flagged as a bot, and his IP (200.101.123.122) would
also be added as a bot-IP.  Blocking anyone else at that IP.

Secondly, if the URL didn't match at all, and the IP wasn't on the
blocklist already, and it is, then the RBL check shows that IP as being
on the Spamhaus XBL, so again, its a bot, and its blocked.

&gt;<i> Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to get the ones that login for a sec
</I>&gt;<i> and spew the same url about 4 times in the channel, and then leave.
</I>&gt;<i> They have :8: for their code:
</I>
This is why an IP check should be done on join as well as the URL check,
and anything they say in channel (like the URL they plaster) should also
be checked against both the static lists I have and an RBL check.  The
message can then be blocked and the bot ignored before the user sees the
message.

I may not have time this weekend to work on this as planned, but I'll
try.
