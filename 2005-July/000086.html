<PRE>&gt;<i> Can't .... turn ... off ... chat ... sort ...
</I>&gt;<i> AHHHH!!!   The plugin isn't turned on, but the thing sorts by join 
</I>&gt;<i> order all the
</I>&gt;<i> time and I can't go back to alphabetical.    I kinda likes alphabetical!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Yeah, sorry, it's all kinda rolled into one. What's about to happen is
that you will be able to click a button that will change the sorting of
the room namelist. Bear with me here ;-)



&gt;<i> The thumbnails in chat rooms aren't displayed the same as the 
</I>&gt;<i> thumbnails in IMs.
</I>&gt;<i>     Not all thumbs fit in the chat room &quot;box&quot; - not sure if thats fixable.
</I>
It is. I turned off icon scaling, because after looking at config.txt, I
noticed that there is a place that specifies the thumbnail size (57 x
77). I thought they all fit that spec. Since I hadn't seen an icon yet
that didn't fit, I assumed it was always followed. I can easily remedy
this by uncommenting a line. :)

&gt;<i> The bio at the bottom of the channel and the age and location and all that is
</I>&gt;<i> kinda duplicating whats in the &quot;Get Info&quot; and take up quite a bit of space.
</I>&gt;<i> Can it be put in a smaller font for the channel and IM windows?
</I>
In order to see &quot;Get Info&quot; you have to click another button, and then
close another window. This functionality is different than that, so I
don't consider it duplication. I will add a feature to disable it. The
font can be made smaller, I just have to find the right gtk call ;-)

&gt;<i> No one has put in the &quot;profile headline&quot; feature into the Get Info window  (or
</I>&gt;<i> in the chat window).  See
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://coolrunningconcepts.com/gaym/Screenshot-getinfo.png">http://coolrunningconcepts.com/gaym/Screenshot-getinfo.png</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>David mentioned that he is working on completely overhauling the
mini-profile. So I assume he will include your ideas.


&gt;<i> I also miss my small joins with blue bios .. but I'll make a plugin to get it
</I>&gt;<i> back one of these days :/
</I>
I can include this in the gaym-extras plugin.

Jason
