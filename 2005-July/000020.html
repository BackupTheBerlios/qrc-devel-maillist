<PRE>I'm getting ready to begin work on this.

My plans are to switch from using ISON to WHOIS for managing the buddy
list.  WHOIS will take a list of comma-separated nicks and return more
information than ISON returns.

The gay.com IRC server does support AWAY (to set an away message) and
WHO (which can show either G(one) or H(ere).  However, no one seems to
currently utilize that mechanism.  This fact, in combination with the
fact that WHO does not support multiple nicks, is why I'm heading to
using WHOIS to manage the buddy list.  (AWAY may still be useful to us
to set our own away messages, and I will keep my eyes open as to how it
might be used.)

This will allow tracking of additional information (such as Bio) in the
buddy list, which can then appear near the buddy's name as well as in
the tooltip.

I plan to use this as an informal status mechanism, ultimately allowing
Gaim's Away mechanism to update the Bio string to show when a GayM user
is away (this practice is already informally used by gay.com members).
When the user is not away, the normal Bio message would be set.

By the way, I've also investigated Gay.com's java applet which has an
&quot;invisible&quot; mode.  The result of enabling invisible is that a &quot;NOTIFY
OFFLINE&quot; is issued to current subscribers.  We don't currently use that
method--and ISON shows these users as online anyway.  I don't think this
is a good method to use for communicating/detecting state/availability.

Please let me know if you have any comments or suggestions on this.

Thanks,
Dave.
