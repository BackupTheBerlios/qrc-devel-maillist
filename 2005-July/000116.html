<PRE>&gt;<i> OK - when you click a user to see the thumbnail, the bio in the tooltip
</I>&gt;<i> goes away.  Any way to make it come back sooner instead of leaving the
</I>&gt;<i> name and coming back?
</I>
Noted. I can fix that easily.

&gt;<i> The icon scaling is definately weird.  Some people have thumbs that fit
</I>&gt;<i> the little frame.  Any clue why mine has a huge border around it?
</I>
The frame should be fixed at 57x77 no matter the size of the icon.
That's how it behaves on mine. Can you send a few screenshots of your
icon area with various icons?

&gt;<i> &gt; *I need to get the bio display in private (IM) windows in a better
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; place. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How about at the top?   Is there a field for chatrooms to have a
</I>&gt;<i> topic-line?  One of the IRC programs I used used to put some of the
</I>&gt;<i> whois information in this line (<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/qrc-devel">user at hostmask</A> I think) as a visual clue,
</I>&gt;<i> and interface-wise that worked out well.  Having the bio at the top
</I>&gt;<i> where the topic-line goes would be nifty.
</I>
I've been trying to get it at the top. If you enable OPT_PROTO_TOPIC
then the topic line appears, but it always has the Topic: label which
makes no sense. Anyway, the topic line does not show up at all for IM
windows, I don't think

It's not much harder to just make a new widget; a label instead of a
text entry area, so it doesn't look like you should be typing things in.
I just have to figure out how to order things correctly. I don't quite
understand box_pack_start and box_pack_end -- visually, they do the same
thing. I might have to tear up and re-pack the boxes to get my own thing
at the top.

In any case, I'll be playing around with that a lot more :)

Jason
