I have no issue so far...

I think ultimately this thumbnail should be shown somewhere else already
without the user having to go to the mini profile to see it.  For
instance, next to the user it belongs to in the channel's member list.

&gt;<i> &gt; My impression here is that this indicates a highjacked thumbnail, which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is often used by bots.  Not sure we want to embrace this practice.  Can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we discuss?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> See comment above.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; *msgs_names now populates the list if gaym-&gt;nameconv is null. So, on a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; join_msg, indicating a successful room join, a names command is immediately
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; sent out. The response of that names message is what triggers list
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; population.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not sure I understand why we need this extra network call.  Are you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; saying the original join result does not give the names in the order you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; want?  What order does the join result give?  What does the java applet
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; do?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When you join a room, the gay.com server responds with a series of
</I>&gt;<i> message #690, one for each user. Unfortunately, these messages come in
</I>&gt;<i> the order of &quot;newest first&quot;. If they came in the order &quot;oldest first,&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> there would be no problem. Assume that there were 5 people in the room
</I>&gt;<i> when you enter, and then one more enters after you. Then if you simply
</I>&gt;<i> sort by the order that the name list was populated, you'd see:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 7
</I>&gt;<i> 6 &lt;---you
</I>&gt;<i> 1
</I>&gt;<i> 2
</I>&gt;<i> 3
</I>&gt;<i> 4
</I>&gt;<i> 5
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Part of this solution has to do with the way gaim handles user joins.
</I>&gt;<i> There is only one signal: chat-buddy-joined. There is no way to
</I>&gt;<i> differentiate the behavior between joins that occur when you enter the
</I>&gt;<i> channel, and joins that occur after you enter the channel. Gaim just
</I>&gt;<i> automatically sorts the list by alpha, so it was never really an issue.
</I>&gt;<i> The best way to handle this would be a patch to Gaim that lets us handle
</I>&gt;<i> this properly. However, one of my goals personally throughout this
</I>&gt;<i> project has been to completely avoid requiring a patch to Gaim, since
</I>&gt;<i> many people are unlikely to bother.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The extra &quot;names&quot; call gives us a way to populate the list in one shot.
</I>&gt;<i> On further thought (i.e., as I've been typing this) I realize that a
</I>&gt;<i> temporary list could be populated as the 690's flow in, and then
</I>&gt;<i> reversed at the end. The trick is detecting the &quot;end&quot;. There is no
</I>&gt;<i> message to demarcate the end, so you have to insert *some* command of
</I>&gt;<i> your own that the server can respond to, that will signal the end.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm fairly certain that the flow of 690 messages will never be
</I>&gt;<i> interrupted. I did a lot of tests, and could not get them to be
</I>&gt;<i> interrupted by an intermediate command. I.e., the text flow always looks
</I>&gt;<i> like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 690 gaydude
</I>&gt;<i> 690 guy
</I>&gt;<i> 690 person
</I>&gt;<i> NAMES
</I>&gt;<i> 690 queer
</I>&gt;<i> 690 lost_dyke
</I>&gt;<i> 690 jailbait
</I>&gt;<i> 690 final_690
</I>&gt;<i> NAMES RESPONSE
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I will make the changes now to avoid the NAMES command. I will replace
</I>&gt;<i> it with a PING, or something. Are there any thoughts about which command
</I>&gt;<i> the gay.com server will give the fastest response for? PING seems the
</I>&gt;<i> most likely candidate.
</I>
Yes, this is where I was going...

And here is another option that involves no extra network stuff.

Reverse the list before the join and again after the join.  I know this
sounds strange, but this way, there is never any worry about a race
condition.  And there are no extra network calls.  To me, its an easy
trade off to have c code that isn't fully optimized to save an
extra network call to the server.  Especially if we are considerate to
those who have dialup connections.
