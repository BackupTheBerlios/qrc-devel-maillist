A good interface reflects the intention of the protocol.  The only
intention I think its valid to deviate from is when you can get some
paid feature at an unpaid price without too much standing on one's head
to do it.  Polling instead of using notifications is one concession in
that area (and is also a good example of why its bad to do this, because
it causes you do work with the protocol in a network-inefficient manner.

&gt;<i> I'll consider other arguments, but the simply doesn't care where the

</I>
The interface should not break the grouping of information.

The IRC-related stuff is more temporal.

The IRC-related stuff does not require additional http requests.  We
should minimize additional http requests when populating chat, IM, buddy
frames.  (Clearly, thumbnail is an exception, and is meant to be so, as
evidenced by gay.com's own client).

The profile stuff should be grouped together, and &quot;Get Info&quot; is the
logical collection of profile stuff.  It is not so &quot;immediate&quot; in that
it is not meant to be changed as often as the bio (notifications are
sent when the bio is changed).

On the larger question, I think we should follow these rules (and we
should settle this at some point by discussing at this level rather than
re-hashing this issue every time something new comes up):

   - Presentation should be as Gaim-like as possible and should be our
     default starting position.  If we deviate, we should have a good
     rationale.  &quot;I like it better&quot;, &quot;Field X is more informative to me
     than field Y&quot;, &quot;Some other application does it this way&quot; are all
     not good enough reasons to deviate.  Like it or not, we are
     supporting integrated chat by working with Gaim, so we should try
     to do it as similarly as possible so as to make it easier for our
     users to understand.

   - Protocol interaction should be as much like Gay.com as possible,
     especially for efficiency and to keep us out of trouble by putting
     too much stress on the Gay.com servers and making them angry with
     us.  Exceptions to this are instances when Gaim consistency
     requires a slightly different approach.  And a long-standing
     exception is allowing the users to have buddy lists with complete
     names instead of truncated names.

   - We should respect logical protocol grouping and reflect that
     grouping within the user interface.

Without respecting such guidelines, what I want to know is what
rationale do we have against someone who wants to display everything in
the user's full profile in the IM or Chat windows?  Clearly there just
isn't enough space for this, but when you say &quot;I want field X from the
user's profile to be displayed in these windows&quot;, I want to know how you
can objectively justify that field and not the inclusion of some 20 other
fields?  &quot;I think this field is as relevant or more relevant than this
other field&quot; is _not_ an objective answer, because someone with a
different opinion can come in and disagree.  Respecting the grouping
inherent in the protocol itself _is_ an objective measure, and can help
us be more effective in our efforts and less arbitrary in our decisions.
