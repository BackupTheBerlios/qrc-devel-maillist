Subject: [Qrc-devel] reply address of list manager
Message-ID: <20050619004616.GK2729@elbert.is-a-geek.org>

I noticed when subscribing to this list, I could not simply hit reply to
confirm my subscription, but had to edit the address from "@berlios.de"
to "@lists.berlios.de".

The same problem is happening on qrc-svn.  Anyone know the fix to it?

This is fixed and committed.  Please test and let me know what
you think (I'm leaving the bug open until I hear some feedback).

My objectives while addressing the bug were:

   - to try and satisfy both those who wanted to join the first
     available room as well as those who wanted to join a certain room.

   - make it work consistently from both the room list and the buddy
     list

   - only use prpl functionality (not extra gtk stuff)

If you join (and save to your buddy list) an =* room, do you get the 
right-click
options of "Room 1" and "Room 2" like you used to?

I would eventually like to re-integrate the "fork".

This would basically mean either a bot-detection plugin and some minor changes
to the challenger plugin, or roll it all into the challenger plugin.  This
would depend on the ability for the challenger plugin to access the lists that
the bot-detection code generates.  Is there an easy (and safe) way for one
plugin to detect if another plugin is in use, and then access the its data
through some structure?

I would also need the to coordinate certain things where the code currently
sends a string right to gaym_bot_detect() ... such as when a new window should
open and it does a WHOIS to get the photo.   Here the bioline is checked for
"bad" URLs.  I've yet to figure out what level the bot-detection plugin would
need to "hook into" to catch this data without having to call gaym_bot_detect
directly, as this would ideally be moved into its own bot-detection plugin.
Basically, gaym_bot_detect needs a string to look at (be it a message or
bioline) and the name of the user that sent that string, and which
protocol/network is being used.  If 1 hook can be done for all messages
including the WHOIS message and all public and private messages, that would be
great.

I think if this can be placed into a separate plugin that can work with or
without the challenger code and the challenger code can optionally use
information from the bot-detection code (if its loaded) then the code paths
should be much easier to develope without keeping things forked.  
Reintegration
would help everyone since it seems no one is even looking at the bot-detection
code as long as its forked.  Forked gaym is at
http://gaym.coolrunningconcepts.com

Suggestions welcome!

There are a number of possibilities.  We should probably work through
the various scenarios so as to narrow the list to choose from.

Signals are what we should look at first for this:

   http://gaim.sourceforge.net/api/pages.html

Also look at gaim-1.3.1/plugins/signals-test.c

I'll be glad if we can work together to achieve this.  Perhaps we can
get a few working sessions on gay.com to this end.

I wasn't able to find a mechanism for achieving that in the room list.

I'm not entirely opposed to it, but was hoping to be consistent between
the room list and the buddy list.

I've heard no objections.  The conversion to bz2 packages is complete.

Subject: [Qrc-devel] nightly build fixed
Message-ID: <20050620140410.GB9819@elbert.is-a-geek.org>

Apparently, my nightly build script was too brittle, and although it
would get the latest updates from svn, it kept producing builds marked
as 2005-06-10.

I only noticed it this morning.  But it is now fixed.  I've deleted any
packages marked 2005-06-10, because they did not in fact contain builds
from that date.

I've just committed a change to achieve this.  There is a preference
item that determines how many instances will be shown in both the
roomlist and the context menu.

Please let me know if this is ok.

Subject: [Qrc-devel] Lets make a release of qrc-0.34.0 soon
Message-ID: <20050625172139.GA6737@elbert.is-a-geek.org>

Hi Everyone,

I would like to make a release of qrc-0.34.0 soon.

While we still have much to do, I think it is time to make a new release
so that people don't have to find some nightly build to use the new
features that have been added since 2004-12-13.

Of course, we should be arguably better that the 0.21.0 or 0.33.0
releases, and should not have regressed in comparison to those releases
(in any way).

To that end, I've committed "Bio-Based Chat Room Activity Filtering" to
svn.  This is to address the deficiency (regression) caused when I
earlier removed hard coded bot filtering strings.  It is a patch I
constructed some time ago and and discarded because it didn't seem all
that effective (I was trying to make something that handled both chat
room and IM issues).  In light of bot-challenger, I've reworked it to
apply only to chat rooms.  Otherwise, its primary difference from the
earlier approach is that none of the strings are hard coded, it can be
turned on/off, and it doesn't add to the ignore list when triggered.

This commit merits some discussion.  First, let me note that this is
only an interim solution so that we can make a release soon.  It is not
by any means the last word on bot-filtering.  It is only an attempt to
get qrc to a state where we can build an interim release.

Second, it may be rightly argued that this belongs in a plugin.
However, gaim-1.3.1 does not provide signal access to join messages
(which is where data from the user's bio is currently seen outside of
the prpl itself).  This means we either need to provide a patch to gaim
or otherwise come up with some exceptional hacking.  In other words,
this is not easily available for a short term interim release.

Third, I would still like to see some more of Evan's bot filtering ideas
and patches in qrc, but I would like to follow a more "correct" approach
to these so that they don't end up getting discarded or re-worked later
(as my commit will be when we properly integrate Evan's).

Finally, I would like to remove "Only buddies may open an IM session to
me", and then have perhaps a week of feature freeze / testing before
releasing qrc-0.34.0.

Please let me know what your thoughts are on all of this.  I think as of
now, we should have no regressions from any of the previous interim
releases, but I can't say this on my own.  Verification and testing from
others is needed.

Thanks,
Dave.

Please compare with the fork.  You are dividing up a filter for rooms
and a filter for IMs, but you were the one that wanted to keep things
consistent.  If you are going to put a bot filter in SVN, just merge in
the fork.  Otherwise the lack of integration and rather limited
usefulness is only going to give people a bad impression.

I've not had a single bot IM me or spam a channel .. or rather .. not
that I could see, and I have the challenge/response set to only
challenge people already marked as bots so I'm never annoying the vast
majority.  In fact, I'm pretty close to 100%.

leave it out or put it all in.

Join issues can be solved with the same hack that is used for making
system messages smaller.  In fact - you can catch & filter all text that
way.

I've been super busy lately - look through the code - it isn't THAT bad!

I don't have a problem with that :)

Evan,

Thank you for sharing your opinions on the topic of whether we are ready
for an interim release.

Please note that I'm unwilling to go with an "all or nothing" approach
with respect to merging your changes into svn for this interim release.
A few of the primary reasons are:

  - Your changes are not yet appropriate for full merge.  Even your own
    comments within the code indicate this.  Comments such as "This
    seems to change all protocols."

  - Your changes are to an older version, and as such cannot quickly be
    merged into the current version.  There is not even a patch to
    consider.  We are all busy.  It will take much time to compare your
    source code with current svn and identify which are the relevant
    differences.  (FYI...most projects require proposed patches to be
    made against HEAD.  And with good reason.  Its very hard to know
    what someone intends when their patch appears to roll back fixes and
    improvements made since the patch was created.)

  - The argument that "its not good enough" does not hold for an interim
    release of beta software:  if it did, we wouldn't have made any
    releases yet.  The question that must be answered for an interim
    beta release, is "can we say that the release is  better than the
    previous release?".  And if you are arguing that No Filtering is
    better than Some Filtering, please make your case with detailed
    facts.  The previous Filtering was similar to what is in svn now,
    except what is in svn now is not hard coded.  This is better because
    a user doesn't have to recompile the software just to
    add/change/delete a filtering rule.

But as a compromise, I've added the retrieval and use of GayBoi's spam
list, in addition to the customizable filtering rules.  I've also heard
from others that this is a greatly desired feature.

In summary, I haven't seen any logic indicating that current svn is
worse than what was in our previous interim beta releases
(0.21.0/0.33.0).  But I remain open to additional facts in this regard.
And in absence of such facts, I intend to proceed as proposed.

And I remain committed to work with you so as to incrementally bring
more of your changes into svn.  But this will require effort and
cooperation on both of our parts--as our schedules permit.  And when we
don't have time, it shouldn't force delay onto other aspects of the
project.

Thanks again for your input,
Dave.
