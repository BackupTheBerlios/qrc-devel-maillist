Subject: [Qrc-devel] gaim for gaim2 status?
Message-ID: <7dd7ab490606281657r5eb12966od066659d8a182c02@mail.gmail.com>

Hey!

So.  Just having found this list, I'll try this again...  I maintain
the gaim-gaym package for fedora extras, and as of today, gaim
2.0.0beta3 is the default version for the upcoming fedora core 6.
(Due out in roughly a month, if memory serves).  gaim2 is also the
default in the test releases of fc (rawhide, fc6t2, etc) as of today,
so gaim-gaym is officially broken.  I don't want that to happen,
especially as I'd like to keep on chatting on gay.com.  :)

I've had a heck of a time tracking things down, but --

1. Is sourceforge or berlios the "real" home of the source repositories, etc?
2. I assume this is the actual, correct list for this conversation.  Heh.
3. I'm given to understand that there is support for gaim2 beta3 in
SVN/CVS.  Is this correct, and if so...
4. Could someone make a tarball of a known working CVS checkout, and
post it to sf/berlios?  (A md5sum check of posted upstream tarballs is
policy for extras builds.)

I'm happy to help out in other areas of development, as time allows,
but right now my focus is on making sure gaim-gaym isn't broken for
who-knows-how-many as they switch to fc6 in the not-too-distant
future.

Thanks! :)
                                   -Chris
