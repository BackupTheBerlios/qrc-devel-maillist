IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN DEVELOPMENT, OR DISCUSSION RELATED TO 
DEVELOPMENT PLEASE SUBSCRIBE TO qrc-devel at berlios.de.

No further development discussion should occur on this list. This list 
is for usage-level discussion.

Wow. Quite a discussion suddenly appears here. Let me add my comments:

1. We ain't porting nothin' to Win32 (or Win64). 'nuff said.

1.5. I prefer SVN 1000 times more than CVS. If Sourceforge supports SVN 
repositories, I'll be happy to move back there.

2. While Garrett may have been a little catty and abrasive, responding 
with bitterness and concluding with "GO AWAY" is no more constructive, 
despite the existence of good points.

3. I've not worked on the plugin much lately, because it works for me, 
and frankly, I've got an essentially infinite number of more important 
things to do. The project has be come too much for one person to manage 
everything. I have put countless hours into the project (I'd say I was 
the primary developer for most of the project). I no longer feel like 
trying to fix every bug in two plugins, and come up with packages for 
distributions that I don't have, and have no interest in installing.

However, if more people were involved in active development of gaym, I'd 
feel that it was more important for me to do my part.

4. There's no need to scrap gaym-extras anymore then the other parts. No 
one is working on gaym-extras because no one is working on anything. 
Gaym-extras adds features that are important to the majority of gay.com 
chatters. I will, however, be OK with making the 1.x version gaym-extras 
an unsupported, use-at-your-own-risk plugin. The API for buddy icons 
really made that one a mess. I got it fixed for 2.0, so it is much neater.

So, here's the minimum of what we need to move this forward:

*A package maintainer. This person will take snapshots of the SVN tree, 
and create packages. This person should also do as much testing of the 
plugin as possible to find bugs.

*A prpl lead. This person should at the very least fix bugs in the prpl.

*A GUI lead. This person should at the very least fix bugs in the 
gaym-extras plugin. If the first two positions were filled, I'd be happy 
to step in here.

Most people don't know about the development list and considering the
status of development, talk anywhere is better than nothing.  However,
between the last message and this one, everyone should now know there is
a development list and how to subscribe.  Thanks!

Unless development picks up, there will be no more user level stuff!
Gaim2 will soon become the default, and we can't compile against the
latest.

Seems as though Sourceforge now has SVN.  I need to go figure out what
my login and password were - not too hard.

BTW - I got work hooked on SVN.  So, unlike before, I'm actually
familiar with it!

A user that is going to come into our project and call it crap because
its not Windows native API has no business using Gaim.  There is Chat
Client and Chattage.

What I would like to see is someone with a Mac and Adium X.  I want to
know if they can compile our plugin!   There are quite a few Mac users
that have trouble with the gay.com java interface and we'd be an
excellent alternative.

I can agree with you on the package thing.   I have no problem with
leaving things as source for Linux personally, and just release tarballs
as we tag releases.  IMHO, it's up to the distribution maintainers or
users to provide binaries.  We'd be more than happy to put up the files
or link to repositories, but we need to concentrate on the code, not
packaging.

As of Gaim2.00 Beta 2, the latest SVN no longer compiles, and this is in
addition to lots of bugs too numerous to mention here.   I've modified
mine so that it compiles cleanly and fixes a couple of the xml escape
problems, but there were so many changes to the tooltip stuff that I
just ended up commenting out some stuff since I'm not at all familiar
with the tooltip code.

I want to go through the old IRC plugin and back port all the new
changes from it, as well as fix the slash commands that are broken,
figure out some of the issues with crashes, get the channel "number" in
the window title after the name (':1' instead of ':*'), get the IRC
'#channel' name out of the hammer dialog, and then start working on
features.

With the changes to the gaim 2 API, its gaym-extras that seems to have
the most difficult to resolve problems, the most changes, and is the
least critical.  Mine doesn't even sort the room-list anymore, which was
the best feature IMHO.  And I believe you wrote ALL of that code didn't
you?   The rest of us have barely looked at it, or at least I haven't
other than a couple changes to make it compile.

Any takers?

I'll volunteer for this one, but I can't check anything in unless we
move back to Sourceforge.

The GUI plugin is nice, but it only loads thumbnails at random these
days, the tooltips just broke, and the room-sort is broke.  Soon, there
won't be anything left.

I still have yet to see a display plugin similar to my old one :(  I
know it was a horrible aweful hack, but it was much more readable, at
least to me, and prevented repeats.
